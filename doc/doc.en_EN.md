## Intro

Hello, friends.

This is the first step for a completely rewritten version for access management via web browser to ensure access to internal networks via OpenVPN. This is _NOT_ secure version at the moment. This will only be reached with version 1.1.0. But I would like to give you the opportunity to test it by yourself today, so that you can contribute ideas or even your own code.

## Upgrade

An upgrade from the original, Release 0.8, will be available with Version 1.1.0.

## Installation

The installation has been tested, but errors may still occur.

My English is usually pretty bad, but with this it works great. ;o)
